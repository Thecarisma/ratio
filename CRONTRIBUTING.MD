# Contributing

Nobody is allowed to commit, push, merge into the master branch, we will use the dev branch for development, the master branch will only have working tested codes, and the dev branch will have code from individual fork, which means no one is allowed to commit directly into the dev branch either, we will all work from our individual fork of the repo.

Each directory in the repo has it own README.MD therefore the README should be read before you do anything in that directory.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Documentation

If you are making any major or minor contribution ensure you take your time to provide proper documentation on your changes. We use the reStructuredText format to create our documentation. The documentation should be created in the ratio project [doc repo](https://github.com/theratioproject/docs/). 

You can read the [README.MD](https://github.com/theratioproject/docs/README.MD) and [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/theratioproject/docs/CONTRIBUTING.MD) guide on the documentations repo to get you started on creating a documentation on your changes.

## Pull Request Process

1. Pull request should only be made to the dev branch of the project and not to the master branch.
2. Pull request into the master branch from a fork will not be entertained at all, only the core member is allowed to create a pull request from the dev branch into master.
3. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
4. Update the README.MD with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
